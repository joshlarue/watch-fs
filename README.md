# fautorun

fautorun is not revolutionary by any means, but I wanted to build my own filesystem watcher that I can use to watch and run files.

## scope

- [ ] watch filesystem for changes with specified filetypes by the user
- [ ] compile/run files on save with the correct runtime automatically
  - [ ] node.js
  - [ ] cargo
  - [ ] java
  - [ ] ... more?
